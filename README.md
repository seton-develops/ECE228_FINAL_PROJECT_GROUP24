Project to convert images from CelebA dataset to bitemoji avatars.


# Download dataset or our pre-trained models


We have already provided the xlsx file for the landmark coordinates inside the ~/Landmark-Assisted-StarGAN/data/train(val) folder. 
You should replace the trainA, trainB, valA, and valB folder with the folder you downloaded from our link. 
NOTE: we did not use the val data for validation. The data in valA(B) folder is for testing.
